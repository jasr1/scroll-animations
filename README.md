## About the Project

This project demonstrates my ability to integrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript effectively to create visually appealing and responsive scroll-based animations. It highlights interactive and fluid UI design principles suitable for marketing, storytelling, or product showcase web pages.

## Live Demo

Check out the [live demo here](https://jasr1.github.io/scroll-animations/) to experience the animations firsthand.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**

- **CSS3**

- **JavaScript (Vanilla JS)**


## Features

- **Smooth Image Rotation**: Images seamlessly transition based on scroll depth, creating a smooth, fluid rotation effect.

- **Zoom Controls**: Interactive buttons allowing the user to zoom in and out dynamically, with multiple zoom levels.

- **Preloaded Images**: All images are preloaded to ensure smooth scrolling and animation without lag.

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly across devices ensuring an optimal viewing experience.

- **Reset Functionality**: Easily revert all customizations and return to the default view.

## Installation and Usage

To view or modify this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jasr1/scroll-animations.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd scroll-animations
```

3. Open the index.html file in any modern browser to experience the animation directly.


## Project Structure


```
scroll-animations/
├── img/                  # Contains the animation images
├── scripts/
│   └── script.js         # JavaScript functionality
├── styles/
│   └── main.css          # Styles for layout and responsiveness
└── index.html            # Main HTML file
```


## Customization

- **Image Sequence**: Change or add images in the ```img``` directory. Update ```frameCount``` in ```scripts/script.js```.

- **Zoom Levels**: Adjust zoom amounts in the JavaScript file (```zoomInAmount```, ```zoomOutAmount```) for different zoom experiences.

- **Styles**: Customize the design via CSS in ```styles/main.css```.

## Performance Optimization

- **Image Preloading**: Images are preloaded to avoid scroll stuttering.

- **Canvas**: Efficient rendering of images to enhance animation smoothness.

- **Minimal DOM Manipulation**: JavaScript efficiently updates only necessary elements.

## Potential Enhancements

Future improvements might include:

- Enhanced mobile device compatibility and touch interactions.

- Adding more animation effects (fade, slide, etc.).

- Implementing additional UI controls and user customization options.

- Optimizing further for performance (lazy loading, compression techniques).
